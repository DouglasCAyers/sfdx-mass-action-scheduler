Mass Action Scheduler
=======================

![screen shot](images/wizard-choose-source.png)

Overview
--------

Declaratively schedule Process Builder, Flows, Quick Actions, Email Alerts, Workflow Rules, and Apex to process records from Reports and List Views.

* **Declarative** - no code necessary, never write batch apex again for queries that can be expressed in a report or list view and actions that can be expressed in a declarative alternative
* **On Platform** - everything happens in Salesforce so no exporting or uploading data
* **Timely** - run actions manually or schedule hourly, daily, weekly, or any time in between

Inspired by Marie Chandra's idea [Ability to Schedule when Process Builder Triggers](https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=08730000000DjEmAAK).

Inspired by Narender Singh's idea [Ability to schedule flows, workflows and processes in process builder](https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=0873A000000EA71QAG).

No more waiting for records to be updated or creating clever workarounds to cause records to be updated to cause these actions to fire.

What you can do with Mass Action Scheduler
------------------------------------------

I'm sure you will think of all kinds of ideas how you can use this app. Here are a few ideas:
* Run a process monthly, maybe to create a record or callout to an external system
* Run data correction actions daily
* Automatically add leads and contacts to campaigns based on report or list view criteria
* Send emails on a periodic basis
* Create "infinite" flows that continuously loop on a schedule
* Perform field updates without exporting or importing data
