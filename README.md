## üßê About the Project

Put the power of [Batch Apex](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_batch.htm) within reach of [declarative configuration](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=extend_click_intro.htm&type=5). Declaratively schedule Process Builder, Flows, Quick Actions, Email Alerts, Workflow Rules, or Apex to process records from Reports, List Views, SOQL, or Apex.

Inspired by Marie Chandra's idea [Ability to Schedule when Process Builder Triggers](https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=08730000000DjEmAAK).

Inspired by Narender Singh's idea [Ability to schedule flows, workflows and processes in process builder](https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=0873A000000EA71QAG).

No more waiting for records to be updated or creating clever workarounds to cause records to be updated to cause these actions to fire.

<br />

## ü¶Ñ Features

üôå **Declarative** - no code necessary, never write Batch Apex again for queries that can be expressed in a report or list view and actions that can be expressed with a declarative alternative.

‚òÅÔ∏è **On Platform** - everything happens in Salesforce so no exporting or uploading data necessary.

‚è∞ **Timely** - run actions manually or schedule hourly, daily, weekly, or any time in between.

<br />

## üó∫ Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/douglascayers-org/sfdx-mass-action-scheduler/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

### üõ† Install Source Code

‚ö†Ô∏è For general use of Mass Action Scheduler you don't need to deploy the source code. I recommend that you install the managed package instead as it's easy, simple, and you don't have to worry about Apex test coverage on deployment.

For developers wanting to üîç explore or üíª make changes to the code, keep reading.

This repository is organized using [Salesforce DX](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/trails/sfdx_get_started).
You may install the source code from GitHub and make any desired adjustments.
You are responsible for ensuring unit tests meet your org's validation rules and other requirements.

First, clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/douglascayers-org/sfdx-mass-action-scheduler.git
```

Change directory into the project folder.

```
cd sfdx-mass-action-scheduler
```

Create a new scratch org.

```
sfdx force:org:create -a mas -s -f config/project-scratch-def.json
```

Push the source metadata into your scratch org.

```
sfdx force:source:push
```

Assign the permission set to your user. 

```
sfdx force:user:permset:assign -n Mass_Action_Admin
```

Create a test account, only required for the report tests.

```
sfdx force:data:record:create --sobjecttype Account --values "Name='dca_mass_action: MA Test Account'"
``` 

Run unit tests.

```
sfdx force:apex:test:run --codecoverage --resultformat human --wait 10
```

Open the scratch org and enjoy!

```
sfdx force:org:open --path //lightning/o/Mass_Action_Configuration__c/list
```
